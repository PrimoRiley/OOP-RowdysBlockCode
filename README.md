Both judges gave us 36/40. I would aagree with their assesment, we met all the technical requirements. We lost a couple points on the presentation part of the demo wich is understadable when we were both nervous. 1: Used fundamental OOP concepts, 2: USed at least 3 Design Patterns (One was built into pygame), 3: Did Unit/Hypothesis testing with coverage, 4: Had all docstrings and html documentation generated, 5: Used Kanban board and video recorded reviews, 6: Teamwork worked together evenly, 7: Project requirements and execution maybe a little less than clear on presentaion/demo, 8: All participated in demo with slides.

## Abstract
Rowdy's Block Code is an interactive game designed to engage young students in the basic concepts of coding. The player of the game must connect a series of movement and interaction blocks to navigate the main character, Rowdy, to his food. The project will take an object-oriented approach utilizing pygame, a set of python modules designed for writing video games. The game will also include a friendly user interface stemming from tools within the pygame module.
